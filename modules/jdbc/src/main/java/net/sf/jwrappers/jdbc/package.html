Provides base classes to construct JDBC wrappers.
<h2>What are JDBC wrappers?</h2>
<p>
JDBC wrappers use the well known proxy pattern to intercept calls to the
JDBC layer. They are useful in situations where you need to alter the behavior
of the JDBC layer or when you need to guarantee that whenever a given JDBC method
or set of JDBC methods is called in your program, some action is triggered. A
very basic use case is to log all SQL statements executed via JDBC.
When carefully designed, JDBC wrappers can also be used to transparently compensate for
subtle differences in behavior between database systems or JDBC drivers. This
problem mainly arises when migrating an existing application to a new database
engine. Examples include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>While with most databases, the semantics of {@link java.sql.ResultSet#getString(int)}
      are identical for <tt>CHAR</tt> and <tt>VARCHAR</tt> columns, DB2 and Derby pad values
      of <tt>CHAR</tt> columns to the declared maximum length.</li>
  <li>Some databases support {@link java.sql.Types#NULL} as argument in calls
      to {@link java.sql.PreparedStatement#setNull(int, int)}, while others don't.</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

-- layer between JDBC and some framework

It is composed by a set of proxy classes that implement the
standard JDBC interfaces such as {@link java.sql.Connection} or {@link java.sql.Statement}.
In general, most of the methods in these proxies will simply delegate to the target ("real") JDBC
objects, while some of the methods will add some new behavior.
While the proxy pattern is in principle straightforward, when applying it to JDBC the following
difficulties have to be faced:

<ul>
  <li>Large number of methods</li>
  <li>Only control on DataSource or Connection</li>
  <li>methods that create other JDBC objects</li>
  <li>Statement -> PreparedStatement -> CallableStatement</li>
</ul>
